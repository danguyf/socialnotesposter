## Introduction
At the time of this writing, neither the WordPress app nor the Jetpack app for Android handle posting Social Notes, 
a feature of the Jetpack Social plugin for WordPress.  I expect this will be rectified shortly.  In the meantime...

## Features
- Authenticate to a single WordPress site.
- Post social notes.
- Save, load, and delete drafts of social notes.  (Drafts are stored locally and synced with the WordPress site.)

## Limitations
- Does not support integrating with more than one WordPress site.
- No display or management of published social notes.

## Roadmap
I have no plans for future development. That has not stopped me from continuing to add and refine features.

## Contributing
- Feel free to submit ideas and change requests as Issues.
- Please do not submit questions about how to use the app as Issues.
- By all means submit Pull Requests.
